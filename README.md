# ðŸŒ± Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Welcome to the **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard**! This interactive project explores the fascinating world of microbes that colonize human navels using data visualization tools such as D3.js and Plotly.js.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The dataset used for this dashboard catalogs microbes found in human belly buttons. The key findings highlight that while a small number of microbial species are present in more than 70% of individuals, the remaining species are relatively rare.

This dashboard enables users to:
- Visualize the **top 10 microbial species** found in each individual.
- Explore **all microbial species** through interactive bubble charts.
- View an individual's **demographic information**, including ethnicity, gender, age, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Interactive Dropdown Menu**: Select an individual by ID to update charts and metadata dynamically.
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for the selected individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes all OTUs, with marker size and color representing sample values and OTU IDs, respectively.
- **Demographic Info Panel**: Displays metadata such as age, gender, and location.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for compatibility across devices.
